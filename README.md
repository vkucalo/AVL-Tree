# AVL-Tree

A generic AVL self balancing binary tree implementation which supports insertion, deletion and lookup in log(n) time.
The self balancing algorithm checks wether two subtrees of a node differ in height by more than 1, and if so, rotate the node accordingly.
Made by Viktor Kučalo and Ivan Cuculić.
